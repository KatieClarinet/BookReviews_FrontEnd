    "review": `What can I say about this book? Honestly, it blew me away. 
    Set in Glasgow in the early 80s, this is the gut-wrenchingly sad story of a little boy and his alcohol dependant mother.
    Raw and disturbing, Stuart’s writing puts me in mind of Yanigahara’s A Little Life, as both books follow the struggle of a main character with an abusive childhood.
    ~
    Shuggie is one of the most compelling characters I’ve come across in a long while, and his love for his mother is so pure and beautiful. This book may leave you broken but also in admiration of Shuggie‘s enduring hope.`

    "author": "Octavia E. Butler",
    "title": "Kindred",
    "review": `In 1976, Dana is a 26 year old black American trying to make it as a writer, until  one day she is summoned back in time to save a dying white boy, Rufus. The year is 1815 and, due to the colour of her skin, she is danger and assumed a slave by all who meet her.
    ~ 
    Dana is caught between the past and the present time, tortured by the knowledge that slavery will be abolished in the future, but knowing that will not help her friends of the time. Adamant that she will not be a slave, she tries to advocate for black rights but her actions are hindered by the antebellum laws of the time.
    ~
    A heart-wrenching read, Butler brings to life the unimaginable horrors of black slavery and makes us consider: what does it take to make a person a slave? The scary reality is, it takes less than we think.
    ~
    Not an easy read (there is no glossing over the hard bits in the book) but a fantastic, thought provoking one. My first book by Butler but definitely not my last!`

    "author": "Megan Hunter",
    "title": "The Harpy",
    "review": `“I used to imagine her anger as a parasite that lived in her stomach, that passed through the wall of her womb to my mother, who passed it to me.”
    ~
    When Lucy finds out her husband Jake has been cheating on her, they devise a plan to even the playing field: she will hurt him 3 times. He will not know when, and in what form, the hurt will take.
    ~
    Hunter is a very skilled writer and has triumphed in creating such a disturbing story that at times reading this I felt physically sick. She intersperses each chapter with details of Lucy’s obsession with the mythical harpy. The more Lucy hurts Jake, the less ‘human’ she becomes.
    ~
    This book was too sinister for me, however it is beautifully written, rich in symbolism and very cleverly put together. I would be interested to see what Hunter’s other books are like as I think I could enjoy her writing if the subject matter is different. However, I vehemently disliked this one.`
